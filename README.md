## Warpstone
### A mod for Minecraft 1.11.2
#### By IceMetalPunk

Warpstone is a mysterious ore that doesn't exist naturally. Instead, you can craft it using blaz powder, ender pearls, glowstone, and stone. When you break Warpstone Ore (using at least a diamond pickaxe), you'll get pebbles (1 plus 1 extra for each level of fortune on your pickaxe). These pebbles are the core of the Warpstone mod.

Surround a diamond with 8 Warpstone pebbles, and you'll get a Warp Pad. Warp Pads can be linked together to allow you to teleport between them, at the cost of XP.

Combine 3 Warpstone pebbles with 2 gold nuggets to craft a Warp Key. Sneak-and-use a Warp Key on a Warp Pad to copy its location to the key. Then use the key (without sneaking) on another Warp Pad to link the two pads together. Walk on the key-activated pad to teleport to the copied location.
